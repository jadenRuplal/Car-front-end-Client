-The idea of this game is to be a clicker in which you have to beat the AI by reaching the finish line first
-It isnt meant to be really hard but can be if the highest levels are picked
-Players will get the ability to choose one of three vehicles which will go from slowest to fastest reducing the required clicks to reach the finish, the AI will also have these options (color picked at random or fixed based on level)
-In order to make a feel of speeding up after every click the pixels moved will increase with a potential speed showing at the bottom of the screen
